    abstract={We determine the number of projectively inequivalent nonsingular plane cubic curves over a finite field Fq with a fixed number of points defined over Fq. We count these curves by counting elliptic curves over Fq together with a rational point which is annihilated by 3, up to a certain equivalence relation.}

    abstract="The Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transformation (CRYPTO 1999 and Journal of Cryptology 2013) turns any weakly secure public-key encryption scheme into a strongly (i.e., {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}IND{\}}{\backslash}text {\{}-{\}}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}CCA{\}}{\$}{\$}) secure one in the random oracle model. Unfortunately, the FO analysis suffers from several drawbacks, such as a non-tight security reduction, and the need for a perfectly correct scheme. While several alternatives to the FO transformation have been proposed, they have stronger requirements, or do not obtain all desired properties.",
